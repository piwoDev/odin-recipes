        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The origin of the name might be in question but the emphasis on what to pair this dish with is certainly not. With the spicy, sweet, and savoury tones and its 30-minute preparation time for 4 servings, this dish serves to work for you during the morning, the afternoon, the night, and (most importantly) Happy Hour.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather and prepare all of the ingredients above.</li>
            <li>Soak the Dried Rice Noodles in hot water for 10 to 15 minutes or until flexible. Stir the noodles occasionally. Drain water and cover the noodles with a moist paper towel.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the Oyster Sauce, Soy Sauce, Asian Fish Sauce, Maple Syrup, Sugar, and Water.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan or wok at medium-high heat, add Vegetable Oil and Sesame Oil. Stir-fry the Shallots, Chili Peppers, and Garlic for about 2 minutes or until soft. Make some space in the center of the pan and add Chicken. Sear for 1 minute, then mix the entire pan.</li>
            <li>Add the Chinese Broccoli stems and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until tender.</li>
            <li>Add the Chinese Broccoli leaves and stir-fry until they are wilted.</li>
            <li>Add the Sauce and Sliced Scallions. Mix well. Cook the pan until the sauce begins to simmer.</li>
            <li>Add the Rice Noodles and mix the pan for 2 minutes, or until the Rice Noodles are fully cooked and have absorbed the sauce, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Add the Thai Basil Leaves and stir until wilted. Serve on plate or bowl.</li>
        </ol>
