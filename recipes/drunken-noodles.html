        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather and prepare all of the ingredients above.</li>
            <li>Soak the Dried Rice Noodles in hot water for 10 to 15 minutes or until flexible. Stir the noodles occasionally. Drain water and cover the noodles with a moist paper towel.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the Oyster Sauce, Soy Sauce, Asian Fish Sauce, Maple Syrup, Sugar, and Water.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan or wok at medium-high heat, add Vegetable Oil and Sesame Oil. Stir-fry the Shallots, Chili Peppers, and Garlic for about 2 minutes or until soft. Make some space in the center of the pan and add Chicken. Sear for 1 minute, then mix the entire pan.</li>
            <li>Add the Chinese Broccoli stems and stir-fry for 2 minutes, or until tender.</li>
            <li>Add the Chinese Broccoli leaves and stir-fry until they are wilted.</li>
            <li>Add the Sauce and Sliced Scallions. Mix well. Cook the pan until the sauce begins to simmer.</li>
            <li>Add the Rice Noodles and mix the pan for 2 minutes, or until the Rice Noodles are fully cooked and have absorbed the sauce, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Add the Thai Basil Leaves and stir until wilted. Serve on plate or bowl.</li>
        </ol>
