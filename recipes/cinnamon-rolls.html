        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup of Whole Milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Water</li>
            <li>4 cups of Bread or All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of White Sugar</li>
            <li>1 package (1/4-ounce) of Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp. of Salt</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of Butter, melted</li>
            <li>2/3 cup of Brown Sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 tsp. of Ground Cinnamon</li>
            <li>2/3 cup of Caramel Sauce, warmed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Caramel Sauce, warmed (for drizzling)</li>
            <li>1 Apple, peeled and finely chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put Milk and Water in a glass measuring cup and stir. Microwave the mixture for 45 seconds or until the temperature reaches between 105 to 115 degrees F (40 to 46 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Whisk together the 2 cups of Flour, Sugar, Yeast, and Salt in a stand mixer with a paddle. Once incorporated, add the Eggs, Melted Butter, and Milk. Mix at a low speed until the dry ingredients are incorporated with the wet.</li>
            <li>Switch the attachment to a dough hook and add the remaining 2 cups of Flour, 1/2 cup at a time, for 3 to 5 minutes or until a soft dough forms and starts pulling away from the side of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Put the sticky dough to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the dough and chill between 2 hours and overnight. The dough should be easy to handle. </li>
            <li>Grease 2 (9-inch.) round cake pans or 2 (8-inch.) square baking pans. Punch down the dough and cut it in half. Roll out one side of the dough on a lightly-floured surface into a rectangle that's roughly 6-inch. by 16-inches. Repeat with the other half of dough.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir the Brown Sugar and Cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread the 1/3 cup of Caramel Sauce over the rolled-out dough and then cover with half of the Cinnamon and Sugar mixture. Spread half of the Apples over the top. Repeat with the other half of the dough.</li>
            <li>Starting on a long side, roll up the dough to form a log and then punch the seam to seal. Slice the log into 8 pieces that should be around 2-inch. thick. Repeat with other half of dough.</li>
            <li>Grease 2 (9-inch.) round cake pans or 2 (8-inch.) square baking pans. Place the rolls in the pans with the cut-side down. Cover the rolls and let them rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes or until they double in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake the rolls in the pre-heated oven for about 20 to 24 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in the pan or wire rack for about 10 minutes. Drizzle the 1/2 cup of Caramel Sauce over the rolls and serve warm.</li>
